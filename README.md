<h2> About @thomasdrury </h2>

I am currently a university student at De Montfort University, studying Business Entrepreneurship and Innovation. However, my true passion is programming, I learnt to program in basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript at the age of 14 in my spare time. At school I progressed and learnt basic python and at college I did a level 3 BTEC in computer programming and achieved a D*/D*/D*. During college I learnt the fundamentals of computer science and covered a wide range of subjects including:
  
  - IT Systems Security and Encryption
  - Website Development
  - Games Development
  - Software Design & Development Project
  - Computer Networking
  - Relational Database Development

When the COVID-19 pandemic started I decided to learn C# and Unity to make some small games to keep myself busy. During this process I realised that I enjoyed creating UIs so decided to transition back to web development. I am currently learning React JS through Udemy and YouTube tutorials whilst creating projects on the side to advance my learning.
